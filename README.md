## How it works
  
1) I started my implmentation by getting the sections of the page and storing them in a const for future use
2) Then i implmented a function that loops through current page sections and build the navbar accordingly 
3) then i added the event lisenter ( to listen for scrolling event ) to detect the current position of the window and the relative positions of the navbar and page sections to change their state from active to not active and vice versa when they are currently viewed
4) Also used the scroll to function to smoothly scroll the user to the desired section when the corresponding button is pressed
